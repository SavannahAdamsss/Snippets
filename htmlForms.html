<!-- Ok, now we're ready to go to HTML and code our form. 
To build our contact form, we will use the following HTML elements: 
<form>, <label>, <input>, <textarea>, and <button>. -->




<!-- Basic Form: -->
<form action="/my-handling-form-page" method="post">

</form>

<!-- This element formally defines a form. 
It's a container element like a <div> or <p> element, 
but it also supports some specific attributes to configure the way the form behaves. 
All of its attributes are optional but it's considered best practice 
to always set at least the action attribute and the method attribute. -->

<!-- 1.The action attribute defines the location (URL) where the form's collected data should be sent when it is submitted.
     2.The method attribute defines which HTTP method to send the data with (it can be "get" or "post"). -->





<!-- The <label>, <input>, and <textarea> elements -->

<form action="/my-handling-form-page" method="post">
    <div>
        <label for="name">Name:</label>
        <input type="text" id="name" name="user_name">
    </div>
    <div>
        <label for="mail">E-mail:</label>
        <input type="email" id="mail" name="user_mail">
    </div>
    <div>
        <label for="msg">Message:</label>
        <textarea id="msg" name="user_message"></textarea>
    </div>
</form>

<!-- Note the use of the for attribute on all <label> elements; it's a formal way to link a label to a form widget. -->

<!-- On the <input> element, the most important attribute is the type attribute. 
This attribute is extremely important because it defines the way the <input> element behaves. 
It can radically change the element so pay attention to it. -->

<!-- In our simple example we use the value text for the first input — 
the default value for this attribute. 
It represents a basic single-line text field that accepts any kind of text input.
For the second input, we use the value email that defines a single-line text field 
that only accepts a well-formed e-mail address. This last value turns a basic text 
field into a kind of "intelligent" field that will perform some checks on the data 
typed by the user. You'll find out more about form validation in the Form data validation article later on. -->

<!-- The syntax of <input> vs. <textarea></textarea>.
The <input> tag is an empty element, meaning that it doesn't need a closing tag. On the contrary, 
<textarea> is not an empty element, so you have to close it with the proper ending tag. 
This has an impact on a specific feature of HTML forms: the way you define the default value. 
To define the default value of an <input> element you have to use the value attribute like this: -->

<input type="text" value="by default this element is filled with this text" />

<!-- On the contrary, if you want to define the default value of a <textarea>, 
you just have to put that default value between the starting and ending 
tag of the <textarea> element, like this: -->

<textarea>by default this element is filled with this text</textarea>




<!-- The <button> element -->

<!-- Add a button to allow the user to send their data once they have filled out the form. 
This is simply done by using the <button> element; add the following just above the closing 
</form> tag: -->

<div class="button">
  <button type="submit">Send your message</button>
</div>

<!-- You'll see that the <button> element also accepts a type attribute — this accepts one of three values: submit, reset, or button.

-  A click on a submit button (the default value) sends the form's data to the web page defined by the action attribute of the <form> element.
-  A click on a reset button resets all the form widgets to their default value immediately. From a UX point of view, this is considered bad practice.
-  A click on a button button does... nothing! That sounds silly, but it's amazingly useful for building custom buttons with JavaScript. -->




<!-- Basic form styling -->

<!-- Add a <style> element to your page, inside your HTML head. Inside the style tags, add the following CSS, just as shown: -->

<!-- // CSS:
    form {
  /* Just to center the form on the page */
  margin: 0 auto;
  width: 400px;
  /* To see the outline of the form */
  padding: 1em;
  border: 1px solid #CCC;
  border-radius: 1em;
}

form div + div {
  margin-top: 1em;
}

label {
  /* To make sure that all labels have the same size and are properly aligned */
  display: inline-block;
  width: 90px;
  text-align: right;
}

input, textarea {
  /* To make sure that all text fields have the same font settings
     By default, textareas have a monospace font */
  font: 1em sans-serif;

  /* To give the same size to all text fields */
  width: 300px;
  box-sizing: border-box;

  /* To harmonize the look & feel of text field border */
  border: 1px solid #999;
}

input:focus, textarea:focus {
  /* To give a little highlight on active elements */
  border-color: #000;
}

textarea {
  /* To properly align multiline text fields with their labels */
  vertical-align: top;

  /* To give enough room to type some text */
  height: 5em;
}

.button {
  /* To position the buttons to the same position of the text fields */
  padding-left: 90px; /* same size as the label elements */
}

button {
  /* This extra margin represent roughly the same space as the space
     between the labels and their text fields */
  margin-left: .5em;
} -->




<!-- Sending form data to your web server: -->

<!-- to handle form data on the server side. As we said before, 
most of the time an HTML Form is a convenient way to ask the user 
for data and to send it to a web server. The <form> element will define 
where and how to send the data thanks to the action attribute and the method attribute. -->
<!-- We also need to give a name to our data. Those names are important on both sides; 
on the browser side, it tells the browser which name to give each piece of data, 
and on the server side, it lets the server handle each piece of data by name.
To name the data in a form you need to use the name attribute on each form widget 
that will collect a specific piece of data. Let's look at some of our form code again: -->

<form action="/my-handling-form-page" method="post"> 
  <div>
    <label for="name">Name:</label>
    <input type="text" id="name" name="user_name" />
  <div>
  <div>
    <label for="mail">E-mail:</label>
    <input type="email" id="mail" name="user_email" />
  </div>
  <div>
    <label for="msg">Message:</label>
    <textarea id="msg" name="user_message"></textarea>
  </div>

  ...
      
<!-- In our example, the form will send 3 pieces of data named "user_name", 
"user_email", and "user_message". That data will be sent to the URL "/my-handling-form-page" 
using the HTTP POST method. -->
      


<!-- On the server side, the script at the URL "/my-handling-form-page" 
will receive the data as a list of 3 key/value items embodied in the HTTP request. 
The way this script will handle that data is up to you. Each server-side language 
(PHP, Python, Ruby, Java, C#, etc.) has its own mechanism. It's beyond the scope 
of this guide to go deeply into that subject, but if you want to know more, 
we have provided some examples in the Sending form data article. -->
